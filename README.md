# ðŸ’° Banking Dataset Analysis & Visualization

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of a banking dataset, offering insights into customer demographics, transaction trends, account behaviors, and branch/manager performance. The visual dashboard provides a clear and interactive overview of key banking metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Overview

The visualizations include:

* **Customer Count by Age Group:**
  Understand customer demographics, with the majority falling in the 51â€“65 age range.

* **Utilization Distribution:**
  A scatter plot showing the relationship between credit limit and balance utilization.

* **Transaction Trend by Type:**
  Monthly trends for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, highlighting seasonal behavior.

* **Branch & Manager Performance by Customer Count:**
  A pie chart representing equal customer distribution across branches.

* **Branch & Manager Performance by Balance:**
  Horizontal bar chart showing total balance managed by each branch and manager.

* **Account Tenure Distribution:**
  Comparison of active vs inactive accounts across different account types (Savings, Checking, Investment).

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI / Tableau / Excel** *(whichever tool you used)*
* Python (for data preprocessing, if used)
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
* CSV / Excel Dataset

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

* Customer demographics (age, tenure)
* Credit limits and balances
* Transaction history
* Account types and statuses
* Branch and manager assignments

> *Note: Dataset is anonymized and synthetic for analysis purposes.*

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

* Customers aged **51â€“65** represent the largest age group.
* **Savings accounts** are the most commonly held and also have the highest active tenure.
* There is a **notable spike in withdrawals in March**, possibly due to tax or financial year-end activities.
* Branch performance varies significantly when analyzed by **balance vs. customer count**.
