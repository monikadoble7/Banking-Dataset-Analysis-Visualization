📊 Banking Dataset Analysis & Visualization

📌 Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data from a banking dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can assist in better decision-making for marketing, customer targeting, and service improvements.

⸻

📁 Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes information on customer demographics and banking behavior. Typical columns may include:
	•	Customer ID
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Marital Status
	•	Account Type
	•	Balance
	•	Transactions
	•	Loan Status
	•	Credit Score
	•	Employment Status
	•	Region/Location

⸻

📈 Key Steps Involved:
	1.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Handling missing/null values
	•	Removing duplicates
	•	Correcting data types (e.g., date formats, categorical encoding)
	2.	Data Exploration (EDA):
	•	Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
	•	Distribution of age, gender, balance, and account types
	•	Correlation analysis between variables (e.g., balance vs credit score)
	3.	Visualizations:
	•	Bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., account type vs gender)
	•	Histograms for continuous variables (e.g., balance, age)
	•	Pie charts for customer segmentation
	•	Heatmaps for correlation matrices
	•	Time series plots for monthly transactions or balance trends
	•	Geographical maps if location data is available
	4.	Insights & Findings:
	•	Who are the bank’s most valuable customers?
	•	Which regions show the highest loan default rates?
	•	Relationship between age, account type, and credit score
	•	Which customer segments are more likely to apply for loans?
	5.	Dashboard (Optional - Power BI / Tableau):
	•	Interactive filters (age group, region, gender)
	•	KPIs like average balance, total loans, customer count
	•	Drill-down charts for managers to explore specific groups

# 💰 Banking Dataset Analysis & Visualization

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of a banking dataset, offering insights into customer demographics, transaction trends, account behaviors, and branch/manager performance. The visual dashboard provides a clear and interactive overview of key banking metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The visualizations include:

* **Customer Count by Age Group:**
  Understand customer demographics, with the majority falling in the 51–65 age range.

* **Utilization Distribution:**
  A scatter plot showing the relationship between credit limit and balance utilization.

* **Transaction Trend by Type:**
  Monthly trends for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, highlighting seasonal behavior.

* **Branch & Manager Performance by Customer Count:**
  A pie chart representing equal customer distribution across branches.

* **Branch & Manager Performance by Balance:**
  Horizontal bar chart showing total balance managed by each branch and manager.

* **Account Tenure Distribution:**
  Comparison of active vs inactive accounts across different account types (Savings, Checking, Investment).

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI / Tableau / Excel** *(whichever tool you used)*
* Python (for data preprocessing, if used)
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
* CSV / Excel Dataset

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

* Customer demographics (age, tenure)
* Credit limits and balances
* Transaction history
* Account types and statuses
* Branch and manager assignments

> *Note: Dataset is anonymized and synthetic for analysis purposes.*

## 📈 Key Insights

* Customers aged **51–65** represent the largest age group.
* **Savings accounts** are the most commonly held and also have the highest active tenure.
* There is a **notable spike in withdrawals in March**, possibly due to tax or financial year-end activities.
* Branch performance varies significantly when analyzed by **balance vs. customer count**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the dashboard:

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-data-visualization.git
   cd banking-data-visualization
   ```
2. Open the dashboard file in **Power BI / Tableau / Excel**
3. Load the dataset if prompted
4. Interact with filters and slicers to explore insights

⸻

🧠 Tools & Technologies:
	•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
	•	Power BI / Tableau (for interactive dashboard)
	•	Jupyter Notebook (for analysis & documentation)
	•	Excel/CSV (as the base data source)

⸻

🎯 Outcomes:
	•	Improved customer understanding
	•	Identification of high-risk loan profiles
	•	Data-driven marketing recommendations
	•	Foundation for predictive modeling (e.g., churn, loan default)

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add predictive modeling for customer churn
* Enable dynamic filtering by region or account type
* Integrate live data source APIs
