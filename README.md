üìä Banking Dataset Analysis & Visualization

üìå Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data from a banking dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can assist in better decision-making for marketing, customer targeting, and service improvements.

‚∏ª

üìÅ Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes information on customer demographics and banking behavior. Typical columns may include:
	‚Ä¢	Customer ID
	‚Ä¢	Age
	‚Ä¢	Gender
	‚Ä¢	Marital Status
	‚Ä¢	Account Type
	‚Ä¢	Balance
	‚Ä¢	Transactions
	‚Ä¢	Loan Status
	‚Ä¢	Credit Score
	‚Ä¢	Employment Status
	‚Ä¢	Region/Location

‚∏ª

üìà Key Steps Involved:
	1.	Data Cleaning:
	‚Ä¢	Handling missing/null values
	‚Ä¢	Removing duplicates
	‚Ä¢	Correcting data types (e.g., date formats, categorical encoding)
	2.	Data Exploration (EDA):
	‚Ä¢	Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Distribution of age, gender, balance, and account types
	‚Ä¢	Correlation analysis between variables (e.g., balance vs credit score)
	3.	Visualizations:
	‚Ä¢	Bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., account type vs gender)
	‚Ä¢	Histograms for continuous variables (e.g., balance, age)
	‚Ä¢	Pie charts for customer segmentation
	‚Ä¢	Heatmaps for correlation matrices
	‚Ä¢	Time series plots for monthly transactions or balance trends
	‚Ä¢	Geographical maps if location data is available
	4.	Insights & Findings:
	‚Ä¢	Who are the bank‚Äôs most valuable customers?
	‚Ä¢	Which regions show the highest loan default rates?
	‚Ä¢	Relationship between age, account type, and credit score
	‚Ä¢	Which customer segments are more likely to apply for loans?
	5.	Dashboard (Optional - Power BI / Tableau):
	‚Ä¢	Interactive filters (age group, region, gender)
	‚Ä¢	KPIs like average balance, total loans, customer count
	‚Ä¢	Drill-down charts for managers to explore specific groups

‚∏ª

üß† Tools & Technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
	‚Ä¢	Power BI / Tableau (for interactive dashboard)
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook (for analysis & documentation)
	‚Ä¢	Excel/CSV (as the base data source)

‚∏ª

üéØ Outcomes:
	‚Ä¢	Improved customer understanding
	‚Ä¢	Identification of high-risk loan profiles
	‚Ä¢	Data-driven marketing recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Foundation for predictive modeling (e.g., churn, loan default)
